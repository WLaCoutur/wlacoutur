## 💭 Philosophy

*"Life is made of paths, not chance, like the neurons of an artificial intelligence that determine choices. Each step, every encounter, and each experience is a node that leads us toward new perspectives."*

**Fun fact:** I've been a Star Trek fan since childhood—not just for space exploration, but for the philosophy of the Prime Directive: exploring new frontiers while respecting and protecting life. This philosophy guides my approach to AI development.
